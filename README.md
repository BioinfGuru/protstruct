1 [Download & Installation](https://salilab.org/modeller/download_installation.html) (Key: MODELIRANJE)

2 Download the 2 files in the modeller folder (.ali & .py)

3 Prepare the target sequence
* Get protein sequence in fasta format from [uniprot](http://www.uniprot.org/)

4 Prepare a template
* [BLASTp](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) the target sequence against PDB to find a suitable template
