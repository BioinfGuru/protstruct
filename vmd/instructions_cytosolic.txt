1 - Prepare a working directory
		New empty folder
		Download the pdb --> biological assembly pdb format --> extract --> rename .pdb1 to .pdb
		Copy + paste template.config.namd into the folder 
2 - load pdb file into VMD
		from wd --> open terminal --> vmd
		vmd main --> extensions --> tk console --> cd to working directory --> ls
		mol new [filename].pdb
3 - create psf file
		vmd main --> extensions --> modelling --> automatic psf builder
		delete all default topology files
		add latest CHARMM Topology Files (downloaded from http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml)
		Usually just top_all36_prot.rtf is needed
			Topology files
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all22_prot.rtf    	all atom additive RTF for proteins, CHARMM22 with CMAP
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all36_prot.rtf    	all atom additive RTF for proteins, CHARMM36 version, July 2012
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all36_na.rtf      	all atom additive RTF for nucleic acids, RNA/DNA updates
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all35_ethers.rtf  	all atom additive RTF for ethers
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all36_carb.rtf    	all atom additive RTF for carbohydrates
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all36_cgenff.rtf  	all atom additive	RTF for general molecules
			- /NGS/toppar/top_all36_lipid.rtf   	all atom additive	RTF for lipids
			- /NGS/toppar/toph19.inp            	extended atom RTF for proteins (and HEME)
			- /NGS/toppar/toppar_water_ions.str 	contains TIP3 water model and ion topology and parameter information
		load input files --> everything --> guess and split
		create chains --> apply patches and finish
4 - solvation (adds a water box)
		mol delete all
		mol new [filename]_autopsf.psf
		mol addfile [filename]_autopsf.pdb
		vmd main --> extensions --> modelling --> add solvation box
		boundary = 1.5
		box padding = set each of the 6 boxes to 20 (angstroms of water padding srrounding the structure)
		solvate
		Is the box big enough to completely contain the protein?
6 - get solvate box size for config.namd
		source ../getBoxSize.tcl
		get_cell
		copy + paste the 4 lines into config.namd file under "Periodic Boundary conditions"
7 - energy minimization (NVE - "https://www.researchgate.net/post/Use_of_NVE_and_NVT")
		open terminal in wd
		namd +p8 config.namd > min.log
		runtime ~20min
8 - Analyse energy minimization
		VMDmain --> extensions --> analysis --> NAMDplot
		file --> select NAMD log file --> log.out
		select total --> file --> plot selected data
		file --> export to ascii vectors
		open multiplot.dat with MSexcel/LOcalc
		Select both columns --> chart --> XY scatter --> lines only
		R click on Y axis --> format axis --> set min and max --> A successful run will show a vertical drop and will end with a horizontal line (meaning the energy was minimized and is in steady state)
		R click graph --> export as image
		If there is still a slope --> edit config.namd --> swtich starting a run to continuing a run --> rerun
		To veiw results --> 
			mol delete all
			mol new solvate.psf
			mol addfile minimized.dcd # minimized coordinates instead of pdb
9 - constant temperature simulation (NVT - "https://www.researchgate.net/post/Use_of_NVE_and_NVT")
		Edit config.namd file
			Starting a run section:		comment out temperature
			Continuing a run section:	uncomment set inputname, binCoordinates, binVelocities
			Set prefix section:			change outputName from "minimized" to "nvt"
			Minimization section:		comment out minimize (in minimization section)
		open terminal
		namd +p8 ../config.namd > nvt.log
		runtime 20min		
		To veiw results --> 
			mol delete all
			mol new solvate.psf
			mol addfile nvt.dcd # nvt coordinates instead of pdb
10 - Analyse constant temperature simulation
		Repeat graph plotting (step 9)
		Select bond, elect, kinetic, vdw, temp, pressavg, total
		Export to ASCIII matrix
		Add header line to matrix in same order as shown on multiplot image
		Plot XY scatter, edit axis min/max, save image
		NB: TOTAL (energy) does not have to be horizontal like before
11 - remove the edits made to the config.namd file in step 9



To change graphics
	mol delete all
	mol new *.psf
	mol addfile *.pdb
	vmd main --> graphics --> representations
	unselect current style + make sure apply changes automatically is switched off
	protein, chains, ribbons, opaque --> create rep
	resname HEME, segname, CPK, opaque --> create rep (this line only if heme present)
